EECS undergraduate student at UC Berkeley. Researcher at [Berkeley Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/) and a member of Large Model Systems Organization ([LMSYS](https://lmsys.org/)), advised by Professor Ion Stoica and Professor Joseph E. Gonzalez. I am part of the [Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/) team, working on Large Language Model Evaluation. 

Currently, I am also a Research Intern at [Nexusflow.ai](https://nexusflow.ai/) working on training Large Language Models (Starling and Raven), with Professor Jiantao Jiao. Previously, I was a software engineering intern at AMD, working on the Visti Model Composer library.

I am facsinated by Large Models and their capabilities in various domains, especially natural language. I am also very passionate about application of statistics and reinforcement learning theory in this domain.
