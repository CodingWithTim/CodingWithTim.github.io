I am a Member of Technical Staff at xAI, on Grok reasoning and post-training. My contributions so far: [Grok 4](https://x.ai/news/grok-4).

Previously, I was an EECS undergraduate at UC Berkeley, where I was fortunated to be advised by [Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/) and built [LMArena](https://lmarena.ai/). During my undergrad, I also spent a year full-time at Nexusflow as part of the LLM post-training team, collaborating with [Banghua Zhu](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~banghua/) and [Jiantao Jiao](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jiantao/). Additionally, I briefly worked as a student researcher at Google AI Research, on reasoning.

I am interested in fundamental problems in training large models, building more capable and reliable models, and solving superintelligence. Some of the concrete problems I have been thinking about recently:
1. How can we transfer intelligence learned in verifiable domains to open-ended questions?
2. Design and formulate less hackable and more interpretable reward signals for presentation and style.
3. Scaling multi-agents for training smarter models.
