I am an incoming CS PhD at UC Berkeley advised by [Sewon Min](http://sewonmin.com/) and [Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/), starting in Fall 2025. I will be part of both [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) and [Sky Computing](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/).

I am currently an EECS undergrad at UC Berkeley, where I am fortunated to work with [Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/) and [Joseph E. Gonzalez](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/). During my undergrad, I also spent a year full-time at Nexusflow as part of the post-training team working with [Banghua Zhu](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~banghua/) and [Jiantao Jiao](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jiantao/). I also part-timed at Google AI Research as a student researcher where I worked on reasoning.

My research interests involve fundamental problems in training large models, more capable and reliable models, and solving superintelligence.
