EECS undergraduate at UC Berkeley.

I am a researcher at [Berkeley Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/) and a member of Large Model Systems Organization ([LMSYS](https://lmsys.org/)), advised by Professor Ion Stoica and Professor Joseph E. Gonzalez. I am focus on building [Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/), working on Large Language Models (LLMs) Evaluation. 

I am also a Research Engineer Intern at [Nexusflow.ai](https://nexusflow.ai/) working on post-training LLMs, including [Athene-70B](https://huggingface.co/Nexusflow/Athene-70B), with Professor Jiantao Jiao.

My research interest lies in the intersection of Large Model Evaluation and Post-Training with a focus on understanding and improving Large Model's general and domain-specific capabilities.
