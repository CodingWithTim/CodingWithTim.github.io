I am a Member of Technical Staff at xAI, on the Grok post-training team.

Before xAI, I was an EECS undergrad at UC Berkeley, where I was fortunated to work with [Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/) and [Joseph E. Gonzalez](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/). During my undergrad, I spent a year full-time at Nexusflow as part of the LLM post-training team working with [Banghua Zhu](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~banghua/) and [Jiantao Jiao](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jiantao/). I also part-timed at Google AI Research as a student researcher where I worked on reasoning.

My research interests involve fundamental problems in training large models, more capable and reliable models, and solving superintelligence.
